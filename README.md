# Motive-Starterhacks2020
Motive is a web application that recommends points of interests that are located in between two different addresses. The purpose of Motive is to make meeting up with a friend easier. User would input where they would want to go (Arcade, club, bar) and two addresses, and the application would bring up points of interest that are located in between the two addresses. That way, commuting to this point of interest would be easy for both parties involved.

Project was developed with Python, HTML/CSS, JS along with the Google Maps API.
